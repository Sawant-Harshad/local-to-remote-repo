Hello All !!
I was in the Local repository earlier. 
Now, I have boarded the remote GitHub repository - "local-to-remote-repo".

Please follow below steps :

1.	Initialize the local repo with Git :
	-	git init

2.	Added & Commited the changes to local repository
	-	git add .
	-	git commit -m "initial commit"

3.	Created and updated local repo with this remote repo
	-	git remote add origin https://github.com/Sawant-Harshad/local-to-remote-repo.git
	-	Verify the remote repo : "git remote -v"

4.	Check for the branch name to be 'main'
	-	git branch
	-	If not, rename the branch to 'main' : "git branch -M main"

5.	To avoid repetitive use of the origin main while pushing, set upstream.
	-	git push -u origin main

6.	Pushing this new change with only 'git push'.
